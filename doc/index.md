# aas-package3-csharp

This is the documentation for the library aas-package3-csharp.
The library allows you to read and write `.aasx` packages, a package format for [Asset Administration Shell (AAS)].

[Asset Administration Shell (AAS)]: https://www.plattform-i40.de/PI40/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/Publikation/Details_of_the_Asset_Administration_Shell_Part1_V3.html

As it name goes, the library operates on packages complying to the [version 3 of the AAS].

The library runs on NET Standard 2.0, NET Standard 2.1, NET 8 and 9 (and probably later versions, but we haven't checked).
It is thoroughly tested and ready for production.

[version 3 of the AAS]: https://www.plattform-i40.de/PI40/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/Publikation/Details_of_the_Asset_Administration_Shell_Part1_V3.html

The documentation is split in three sections:

* [Getting Started](getting-started/intro.md) shows how to install the library and use it in your code.

* [API Documentation](api/index.md) goes through the code base and presents the documentation of individual code units (classes, methods *etc.*).

* [Contributing](contributing/intro.md) explains how to set up & build the solution, run continuous integration and submit your contribution.
