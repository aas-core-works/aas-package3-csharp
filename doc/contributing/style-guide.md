# Style Guide

We subscribe to [ReSharper's InspectCode tool] for enforcing a general coding style guide.

[ReSharper's InspectCode tool]: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/InspectCode.html

We also follow a couple of solution-specific guidelines which we document here.

## Line Width

We enforce max. **90 characters** per line.

This makes it easy for visibility-impaired people to read the code in large font.
This limit also makes it possible to diff in vertical panes in IDE on a laptop.

## Exceptions *versus* errors

Exceptions are meant for parts of the logic which should *very* rarely occur:

* We prefer to return tuples `(result, error)` in most situations instead.
 For example, if you think your clients would write `try ... catch ...` in order to steer program logic, use errors.

* The reason for this decision is that exceptions incur a substantial overhead (see [this StackOverflow question about the cost of exceptions in C#]).
  Notably, imagine if the client needs to run your operation thousands of times â€” the exceptions would be simply prohibitively expensive for such use cases.

[this StackOverflow question about the cost of exceptions in C#]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/891217/how-expensive-are-exceptions-in-c

* For public functions we also provide companion functions prefixed with `Must...`, following the Golang convention, which raise exceptions instead of returning errors.
They are simply meant as shortcuts for use cases where error handling can be handled in a sloppy way (*e.g.*, for experimental code).

## Pre-conditions and Post-conditions

Use [design-by-contract] by implicitly writing checks using `if`-statements.

For pre-conditions, raise `System.ArgumentException` (and related subclasses such as `System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException`).

For post-conditions, raise `System.InvalidOperationException`.

## No Asterisk Usings

Since we do not assume the developers to have the full knowledge of the third-party libraries, help the reader by prefixing the used types.

For example, instead of writing:

```csharp
using System.IO.Directory;
```

write:

```csharp
using Directory = System.IO.Directory;
```

Notable exceptions here are `System.Linq`, `System.CommandLine` and other libraries which introduce [extensions].
Please note in your code when this is the case to differentiate from cases where you simply forgot to alias the used type.

## TODOs

Please do not leave any TODOs in the code.
Write a proper note with:

```
// NOTE(your-username): 
...
```
